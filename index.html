      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a type of container, so letâ€™s start by thinking about containers, and how they are different from virtual machines (vm). In a VM, all apps and bins use their own guest OS on top of the host OS. In a container such as docker, there is no need for guest OS, as all apps can communicate directly with the host OS. The container is a way for the host OS to interface with the bins and libraries, which support the apps directly. Since containers share Oss, they are efficient compared with VMs, which are digital versions of virtual hardware, which means they have a lot of system requirements. Another way to say this is that VMs use a hypervisor that extracts the entire device, while a container just extracts the kernel of the OS, which is all it needs to fully operate.  Container technology is fairly old, but Docker is simply a better version of container because it is open-source and brings standardization to containers.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Like Docker, nginx (Engine-X) is open source. It is a type of load balancer, and load balancers are useful for improving performance of applications by distributing the burdens of managing an app across several servers. Nginx is a software-only load balancer as opposed to the hardware load-balancers, so it is much more efficient and works for cloud computing. Nginx is the most popular software-only load balancer.
